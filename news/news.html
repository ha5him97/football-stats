            <h3>Ballon d’Or 2024: Vinicius Jr, Real Madrid Stars boycott Theatre du Chatelet event in Paris; Here’s why</h3>
            <p>Real Madrid stars Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr, Jude Bellingham, Dani Carvajal along with club president Florentino Perez were absent from the Ballon d'Or 2024 ceremony at Theatre du Chetelet in Paris on Monday, as a mark of protest. Based on a Reuters report, the Real Madrid delegation cancelled their visit at the last minute after the club understood that Vinicius wouldn’t win the top prize.

                The Brazilian forward has been in prolific form in recent times and was favourite to win the coveted trophy, having won the Champions League player of the year enroute to team’s title triumph. Instead, the Ballon d'Or 2024 went to Manchester City midfielder Rodri.</p>

            <h3>Manchester United fires manager Erik ten Hag after woeful start in EPL, Ruud van Nistelrooy to replace him</h3>
            <p>Manchester United finally ran out of patience and fired manager Erik ten Hag on Monday after a troubled start to the season which has left the 20-time English champions languishing in the Premier League amid a period of major upheaval at the storied club.

                Ten Hag, who was hired in 2022, won two domestic cups in his 2 1/2 years in charge but paid the price for leading United to just three wins in nine league games in the opening months of this campaign.
                
                There have been four defeats in there, too, including heavy beatings by fierce rival Liverpool and Tottenham. A 2-1 loss at West Ham on Sunday was Ten Hag's last game in charge, with the Dutchman departing with United in 14th place in the 20-team standings.</p>

His closest competitor is Lionel Messi, who has scored 838 goals so far. The third name is Pele, who scored 762 goals.</p>
